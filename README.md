# Coding-in-LabVIEW
Implementation of compression algorithm such as Shannon- fano coding, Run Length coding, Huﬀman coding technique in LabVIEW software with GUI.
Designed GUI using the concept of pages in LabVIEW. On the first page, the user will be asked to enter values of the probability for Shannon-Fano coding and Huffman coding.
On the second page, the output of Shannon - Fano and Huffman will be shown. An analysis of these algorithms including parameters such as efficiency, average codeword length and entropy will be shown.
On the final and fourth page, Run Length Coding is implemented. It will take input and display output.

Learned about compression algorithms such as Shannon-fano, Run-length, Huﬀman coding technique. Learned about how complex algorithm is designed.
